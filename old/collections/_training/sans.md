SANS is the most trusted and by far the largest source for information security training in the world. We offer training through several delivery methods - live & virtual, classroom-style, online at your own pace or webcast with live instruction, guided study with a local mentor, or privately at your workplace where even your most remote colleagues can join in via Simulcast. Our computer security courses are developed by industry leaders in numerous fields including cyber security training, network security, forensics, audit, security leadership, and application security. Courses are taught by real-world practitioners who are the best at ensuring you not only learn the material, but that you can apply it immediately when you return to the office. All of SANS security courses are also offered at a government customer's desired location. In addition to top-notch training, we offer certification via GIAC, an affiliate of the SANS Institute featuring over 35 hands-on, technical information security certifications in information security, a Master's Degree program through SANS Technology Institute graduate school, as well as numerous free security resources including newsletters, whitepapers and webcasts.
